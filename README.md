# Building-a-Resilient-Cybersecurity-Home-Lab

<h2>📚 Introduction</h2>
Welcome to my first cybersecurity project 🌐💻. I will be building a robust Cybersecurity Home Lab, this is a dedicated environment set up used to simulate real-world cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and security scenarios in a controlled and isolated space. This project will not be about wires and machines but will be done virtually as we gain hands-on learning, develop skills, and experiment with various cybersecurity tools and techniques without the risk of impacting a live network.

<h2>🛠️ Tools That I Used</h2>

- <b>[VirtualBox🔄-(Download the version for your operating system)](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)</b>: This is an open-source virtualization platform that allows us to create and manage virtual machines (VMs). For our cybersecurity home lab, I would be using it to simulate diverse operating systems and network configurations within isolated environments.
- <b>[Kali Linux🏴‍☠️💻-(Download the VirtualBox 64-bit version)](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)</b>: This is a Linux distribution designed for penetration testing, ethical hacking, and cybersecurity activities. In this home lab, I will use it as our primary toolkit for conducting security assessments, vulnerability analysis, and hands-on penetration testing exercises.
- <b>[Windows 11 Operating system 🖥️-(Download the VirtualBox version)](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/)</b>: We would use this OS to provide us with an environment for testing security measures and vulnerabilities. It allows you to explore and understand the security features, configurations, and potential weaknesses present in a Windows environment.
- <b>[Windows Server 2019 🌐-(Download the ISO file)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2019)</b>: This is a server operating system that joins the Windows 11 OS to a server environment. The reason for this is that in a real-world scenario, an attack will be on an active directory environment. For our Home Lab, we would use it to simulate and secure network infrastructures, implement Active Directory services and explore server-side vulnerabilities.
- <b>[Metasploitable 🎯-(The link downloads automatically)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/metasploitable-linux-2.0.0.zip/download )</b>: This is a purposely vulnerable virtual machine designed for penetration testing and security training. I will use it to simulate a target environment with intentionally weak configurations and known vulnerabilities, making it an ideal resource for practicing ethical hacking techniques.</b>


<h2>🔄💻 Required System Requirement: I use an HP ENVY x360 Laptop (Not the best but it does the job)</h2>

- <b>[🧠 CPU: 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1355U 1.70 GHz (Anything higher than this will work)]</b>
- <b>[💾 RAM: 16GB (gigabytes) of RAM (I will say 8 GB of RAM or higher will suffice)]</b>
- <b>[📀 Disk: 1TB (Terabyte) (500GB - 1000GB of free disk space will be enough)]</b>
- <b>[🔄 BIOS/UEFI: VT-x, AMD-V, or the equivalent must be enabled in the BIOS/UEFI]</b>
- <b>[🔧 System Type: 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor (⚠️MANDATORY: This is a must)]</b>


<h2>[📝 Step by Step Guide To Setting Up Your Cybersecurity Home Lab (Note: For this project, we would only be setting up the Home lab and connecting each tool, then using it for future projects.]

- <b>📝 STEP 1: Download and install VirtualBox from the official website. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.</b>

- <b>📝 STEP 2: Download and exact all the other tools (Kali Linux, Windows server 2019, Windows 11 OS, and Metasploitable). Lastly, you can also put everything in a designated folder to make it look organized.</b>

- <b>📝 STEP 3: We are going to create a VM for each tool. > Open VirtualBox and click on "New" to create a new virtual machine for each tool. Repeat the process for each tool. You can check out the video I linked above for a more detailed process</b>

- <b>📝 STEP 4: Connect VMs in a Network > In VirtualBox, select each VM and go to "Settings" > "Network." Choose the "Bridged Adapter" for each VM to connect them to the same network.</b>

- <b>📝 STEP 5: We explore and practice: As I said we are only setting up the Home lab and connecting each tool, then using it for future projects. So keep watch for the next project] </b>

<h2>💡 key lessons and takeaways from this project:</h2>
I laid the foundation for a secure and controlled environment where I can explore, learn, and experiment with various cybersecurity tools and techniques. Understanding how the virtual world works, understanding these tools, and the purpose they serve. So stay tuned for more exciting projects that lie ahead! 🌐💻🚀
