# Building-a-Resilient-Cybersecurity-Home-Lab

<h2>📚 Introduction</h2>
Welcome to my first cybersecurity project 🌐💻. I will be building a robust Cybersecurity Home Lab, this is a dedicated environment set up used to simulate real-world cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and security scenarios in a controlled and isolated space. This project will not be about wires and machines but will be done virtually as we gain hands-on learning, develop skills, and experiment with various cybersecurity tools and techniques without the risk of impacting a live network.
