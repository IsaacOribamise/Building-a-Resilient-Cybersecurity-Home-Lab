# Building-a-Resilient-Cybersecurity-Home-Lab

<h2>📚 Introduction</h2>
Welcome to my first cybersecurity project 🌐💻. I will be building a robust Cybersecurity Home Lab, this is a dedicated environment set up used to simulate real-world cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and security scenarios in a controlled and isolated space. This project will not be about wires and machines but will be done virtually as we gain hands-on learning, develop skills, and experiment with various cybersecurity tools and techniques without the risk of impacting a live network.

<h2>🛠️ Tools That I Used</h2>

- <b>[VirtualBox🔄-(Download the version for your operating system)](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)</b>: This is an open-source virtualization platform that allows us to create and manage virtual machines (VMs). For our cybersecurity home lab, I would be using it to simulate diverse operating systems and network configurations within isolated environments.
- <b>[Kali Linux🏴‍☠️💻-(Download the VirtualBox 64-bit version)](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)</b>: This is a Linux distribution designed for penetration testing, ethical hacking, and cybersecurity activities. In this home lab, I will use it as our primary toolkit for conducting security assessments, vulnerability analysis, and hands-on penetration testing exercises.
- <b>[Windows 11 Operating system 🖥️-(Download the VirtualBox version)](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/)</b>: We would use this OS to provide us with an environment for testing security measures and vulnerabilities. It allows you to explore and understand the security features, configurations, and potential weaknesses present in a Windows environment.
- <b>[Windows Server 2019 🌐-(Download the ISO file)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2019)</b>: This is a server operating system that joins Windows 11 OS to a server environment. For our Home Lab, we would use it to simulate and secure network infrastructures, implement Active Directory services and explore server-side vulnerabilities.
- <b>[Metasploitable 🎯-(The link downloads automatically)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/metasploitable-linux-2.0.0.zip/download )</b>: This is a purposely vulnerable virtual machine designed for penetration testing and security training. I will use it to simulate a target environment with intentionally weak configurations and known vulnerabilities, making it an ideal resource for practicing ethical hacking techniques.
